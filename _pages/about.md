Hobbies
======
I like fencing and playing badminton for sports. And I also love movies and R&B music. There's a quote in my favourite movie Interstellar says: "Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here." It was about exploring the space but it reminds us that our destiny lies beyond our current limitations, whether in space or through AI. I'm ready to take part in pushing the boundaries of AI.
