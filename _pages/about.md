My name is You (Fred) Peng. I am a passionate PhD student in CSE at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof.Binhang Yuan. I got my BSc degrees in Data Science as well as Statistics from the University of Toronto (UofT).

I am skilled in extracting and analyzing data, and I have over two years of experience in machine learning and data science. My research interest currently focused on database related LLM Agent and ML system. Besides AI and Data, I'm also interested in FinTech and preparing for the CFA Level II exam.

Hobbies
======
I like fencing and playing badminton for sports. And I also love movies and R&B music. There's a quote in my favourite movie Interstellar says: "Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here." It was about exploring the space but it reminds us that our destiny lies beyond our current limitations, whether in space or through AI. I'm ready to take part in pushing the boundaries of AI.
